While playing, follow one verb with one noun, i.e. 'look around,' 'go north,' or 'open book. Do not use more than 2 words per statement.'

You wake up sprawled on a cold, ornate marble floor in what appears to be a dimly lit foyer. There are no visible windows, and the small amount
of light there is comes from seemingly nowhere. A heavy-looking mahogany door is to the north. To the west, there is a sleek bench pushed against
the wall. To the east is a console table with a small box on top. A large, old-fashioned candle sits on a pedestal in the centre of the room. The
candle is unlit.
You have 30 turns left to escape.
